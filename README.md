# GameHub

GameHub is a React web application built with Vite and TypeScript. It provides a platform for discovering and exploring games across various platforms. The application utilizes Chakra UI for design, Axios for API requests, and relies on the RAWG.io API for game data.

## Features

- Browse games across different genres and platforms.
- View detailed descriptions and information about individual games.
- Search for specific games.
